A stack is a most popular data structure which follows last in first out principle (LIFO)

stack has (data)+(method implementations) hence we can call it as an abstract data structure


Data in stack 
      We can add data into stack 
methods in stack 
      we can use stack methods to manipulate the stack data 


methods:::::::  
   push()
   pop()
   top()
   isEmpty()
   isFull()



push: to put data at the top of the stack 
pop: to delete data from the top 
top: to get the top most data from stack
isEmpty: to check weather the stack is empty or not 
isFull: to check weather the stack is full or not

# Relational Operators in Python

# Define two variables
a = 10
b = 3

# Equal to
equal_to = a == b
print("Equal to:", equal_to)  # Output: False

# Not equal to
not_equal_to = a != b
print("Not equal to:", not_equal_to)  # Output: True

# Greater than
greater_than = a > b
print("Greater than:", greater_than)  # Output: True

# Less than
less_than = a < b
print("Less than:", less_than)  # Output: False

# Greater than or equal to
greater_than_or_equal = a >= b
print("Greater than or equal to:", greater_than_or_equal)  # Output: True

# Less than or equal to
less_than_or_equal = a <= b
print("Less than or equal to:", less_than_or_equal)  # Output: False

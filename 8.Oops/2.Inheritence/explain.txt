SIMPLE INHERITANCE:

In simple inheritance, a single child class inherits from one parent class.
This allows the child class to reuse methods and attributes from the parent class.
It is the most straightforward form of inheritance, promoting code reusability.
The child class can also define its own unique methods and attributes.

                    Parent
                      |
                      V
                    Child





MULTIPLE INHERITANCE

Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.
The child class can access properties and methods from all the parent classes.
It helps in combining functionalities from multiple sources, but can lead to complexity.
Proper method resolution order (MRO) is important to avoid ambiguity in multiple inheritance.


          Parent1    Parent2
            |          |
            +----------+
                  |
                  V
                Child






MULTI LEVEL INHERITANCE

Multilevel inheritance creates a chain of inheritance, where a class inherits from another class,
which itself inherits from a base class. This forms a hierarchy of inheritance levels.
It allows the derived class to inherit features from multiple levels of the hierarchy.
Each level can add or override methods and attributes.

                        V
                      Parent
                        |
                        V
                      Child






HEIRARICAL INHERITANCE


Hierarchical inheritance involves multiple child classes inheriting from a single parent class.
Each child class can have additional methods and attributes, while still sharing common features from the parent.
It allows code reuse from the parent class across multiple derived classes.
Each child class can function independently but inherits common functionality from the parent.


                        Parent    
                        /    \    
                       /      \   
                   Child1    Child2



                   


HYBRID INHERITANCE

Hybrid inheritance combines two or more types of inheritance, such as multiple and hierarchical.
It involves multiple parent classes and potentially multiple inheritance paths, leading to a complex hierarchy.
This type of inheritance allows combining features from various sources but can increase complexity.
Proper design is crucial to manage and avoid conflicts in hybrid inheritance structures.

                              /   \
                             /     \
                         Child1   Child2
                            \      /
                             \    /

while is typically used when you donot know how many times does you have to run a loop

In traditional programming languages like java and c the syntax is

while condition{
//statements
}

eg:

int i=0
while (i<10){
System.out.println(i);
i=i+1
}


while loop dosen't have auto increment you have in incremenent the looping variable 


in python the while loop syntax is:

while condition:
  //statement
  incremenent



eg


i=0
while i<10:
  print(i)
  i+=1

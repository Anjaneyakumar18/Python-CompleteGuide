lambda functions are also known as Anonymous functions or oneline functions also


Definition: Lambda functions are small, single-expression functions that are defined without a name. The syntax is lambda arguments: expression.

Usage: They are often used for short-term functions that are not going to be reused elsewhere, making the code more concise.

Return Value: Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions automatically return the value of the expression without needing a return statement.

Limitations: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression, which means they cannot have multiple statements or complex logic.

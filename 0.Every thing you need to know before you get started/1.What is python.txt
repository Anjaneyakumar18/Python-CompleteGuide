Python is a interpreted programming language

INTERPRETED:--Code execution is done line by line (one line after it's previous line execution)

Guido van Rossum originally created Python as a successor to the ABC programming language, aiming to correct some of its flaws while adding new features.
Python was designed with an emphasis on code readability and simplicity, making it easier for both beginners and experienced developers to write code.
Guido van Rossum served as Python’s “Benevolent Dictator For Life” (BDFL), overseeing the language’s development for nearly 30 years before stepping down in 2018.
The first official release of Python (version 0.9.0) in 1991 included core features like exception handling, functions, and modules, which are still fundamental to the language today.
Python’s development has continued under the guidance of a strong community, but Guido van Rossum's original vision of simplicity and flexibility remains at the core of the language.

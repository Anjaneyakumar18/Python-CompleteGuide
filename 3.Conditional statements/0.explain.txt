Conditional statements in Python allow the program to execute certain code blocks only when specific conditions are met. Python provides if, elif, and else statements for this purpose.


IF BLOCK::::::::::
if statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is True.

syntax:::::::::::;;;
if condition:
    # Code block to execute


IF ELIF BLOCKS:::::::::::::::
elif statement: Used for multiple conditions; it executes the block if the previous conditions were False and the elif condition is True.


syntax::::::::::;;;;
if condition1:
    # Code block 1
elif condition2:
    # Code block 2


IF ELSE BLOCKS:::::::::::::::::::::::
else statement: Executes a block of code if all previous conditions are False.

SYNTAX::::::::::::::::

if condition:
    # Code block 1
else:
    # Code block 2


NESTED IF BLOCKS::::::::::::


Nested if statements: You can place if statements inside other if blocks for complex conditions.



SYNTAX::::::::::::::;;;;
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Code block

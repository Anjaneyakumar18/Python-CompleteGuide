   4.set: A set is a mutable collection data type which dosen't support any duplicates
   5.Dictonary:Dictonary is a key value paired collection data type


In this folder we majorly discuss about int,float,complex and string 
list,tuple,set and dictionaries are clearly discussed in (data structures/inbulit data structues in python) folder
